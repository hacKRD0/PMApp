# Backend Repository for Stock Management Application

This repository houses the backend for the **Stock Management Application**, designed to handle user portfolios, stock references, and related functionalities. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Sequelize** (connected to a **PostgreSQL** database), this backend ensures robust and scalable API services.

---

## Features

### Core Features:

- **User Management**:
  - Create, update, and manage user accounts.
  - Handle user-specific data such as portfolios and stocks.
- **Stock Reference Management**:
  - Maintain a database of stock references tied to specific sectors.
  - Automatically handle cascading updates and deletions to maintain database integrity.
- **Sector Management**:
  - Manage sectors linked to stocks and references.
  - Assign "Unknown" sectors when existing sectors are deleted.
- **Portfolio Tracking**:
  - Fetch unique dates for uploaded stock data per user.
  - Track user-specific stocks and their associated metadata.

### Additional Functionalities:

- **Database Integrity**:
  - Automatically update `StockMaster` entries when `StockReference` is deleted (via hooks).
  - Use hooks and transactions to ensure atomicity and maintain referential integrity.
- **Efficient Querying**:
  - Fetch unique dates using optimized Sequelize queries.
- **Custom Hooks**:
  - Implement pre-deletion hooks for `StockReference` and `Sector` models to manage cascading effects.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express**: Framework for building robust RESTful APIs.
- **Sequelize**: ORM for database management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing structured data.
- **ESM**: Modern JavaScript module support.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps to Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/backend-stock-management.git
   cd backend-stock-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=your_postgres_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:

   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. **Seed the Database** (Optional):

   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
   ```

6. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
